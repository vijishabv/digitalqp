    <p>The word exam is short for examination, from 19th century student slang. “Exams” – Many of the students got shrink when they heard an exam’s words because their exam mentality is feeble; maybe they don’t know about the importance of exams. Here one question arises every time, “Does an examination is important!?” YES, Obviously exams are the most important. Let me explain to you how!

      All the Exams are a part of growth for the students; they are essential for knowledge & capability testing.
      
      Examinations don’t mean creating a feeling of depression among students. Exams are intended to develop a sense of responsibility among those learners to remember the concepts and present them in the most valuable form.
      
      Testing is a general evolution for the students that they understand that topic or subject!? Exams improve the student’s overall personality, memory, and their revision skills.
      
      Generally, students give oral and written exams in their schools/colleges. They have a wrong belief like an exam is unnecessary, but if they try to think in a detailed positive manner, they can understand the benefits of exams.An exam usually takes place in a class and consists of questions that test a student's knowledge.This is an online quizapplication.

    </p>
    <p>
      The exam develops confidence, which increases a student’s personality in a hardworking manner. Students become conscious of their exam performance if they do hard work and give their best performance.

When students get good marks, they feel happy, and their marks increase their confidence level.An exam is just like a type of healthy competition for proving more knowledge and skill.

Every student prepares themselves as they participate in the competition and most of them to prove themselves better than other students, they try to get more score and also built a new strategy for reading, they improve their writing skills for better marks.
The exam evaluates the student’s ability of learning. It is an effective way to analyze the knowledge of students. It is a measurement of how much they learn and constraint in the study. An exam is for self-improvement.
